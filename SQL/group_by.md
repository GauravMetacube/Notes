## hey , In sql how does group by actually work , I have an confusion like when I am retrieving multiple data from different tables for example i m retrieving product_id from product and category_id  from category using a join and group by product_id then it gives error "Expression #3 of SELECT list is not in GROUP BY clause and contains nonaggregated column "  why so can you explain this in detail

Certainly! The `GROUP BY` clause in SQL is used to group rows that have the same values in specified columns into aggregated data. When you use `GROUP BY`, you are essentially telling SQL to perform an aggregation (like `SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`, etc.) on the data within each group.

Here's a detailed breakdown of how `GROUP BY` works and why you might encounter the error you mentioned:

### How `GROUP BY` Works

1. **Grouping Rows**: When you use `GROUP BY`, SQL groups together rows that have the same value in the specified column(s). For example, if you `GROUP BY product_id`, SQL will group all rows that have the same `product_id` together.

2. **Aggregation**: After grouping, SQL allows you to perform aggregate functions on other columns. Aggregate functions include `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MAX()`, and `MIN()`. These functions operate on the grouped rows and return a single value for each group.

3. **Selection**: When using `GROUP BY`, you must ensure that every column in the `SELECT` list that is not part of an aggregate function is included in the `GROUP BY` clause. Otherwise, SQL won't know how to handle these columns, leading to errors.

### The Error Explained

The error message you’re seeing: 

```
Expression #3 of SELECT list is not in GROUP BY clause and contains nonaggregated column
```

indicates that you are selecting columns that are not part of the `GROUP BY` clause and are not being aggregated. 

### Example Scenario

Suppose you have two tables:

1. **product**: 
   - `product_id`
   - `product_name`
   - `price`

2. **category**: 
   - `category_id`
   - `product_id`

You want to retrieve data with a `GROUP BY` clause, but you’re seeing errors. Let’s say you’re trying to run a query like this:

```sql
SELECT p.product_id, p.product_name, COUNT(c.category_id)
FROM product p
JOIN category c ON p.product_id = c.product_id
GROUP BY p.product_id;
```

In this query:
- `p.product_id` is in the `GROUP BY` clause, so it’s fine.
- `p.product_name` is not aggregated and not included in the `GROUP BY` clause.

### How to Fix It

You have two options to fix this error:

1. **Include All Non-Aggregated Columns in `GROUP BY`**:
   ```sql
   SELECT p.product_id, p.product_name, COUNT(c.category_id)
   FROM product p
   JOIN category c ON p.product_id = c.product_id
   GROUP BY p.product_id, p.product_name;
   ```

2. **Use Aggregate Functions for Non-Grouped Columns**: If you don’t need to group by `product_name`, but rather get some aggregated information for each `product_id`, you might use an aggregate function for `product_name`, although this depends on what you want to achieve. For example, you could use `MAX` or `MIN`:

   ```sql
   SELECT p.product_id, MAX(p.product_name) AS product_name, COUNT(c.category_id)
   FROM product p
   JOIN category c ON p.product_id = c.product_id
   GROUP BY p.product_id;
   ```

In this case, `MAX(p.product_name)` will return the maximum `product_name` for each `product_id`, which might or might not make sense depending on your context.

### Summary

- **Group By Clause**: Groups rows based on specified columns.
- **Aggregation**: After grouping, aggregate functions can be used to summarize data.
- **Error Resolution**: Ensure that all selected columns are either included in the `GROUP BY` clause or are used with aggregate functions.

I hope this clarifies how `GROUP BY` works and how to handle the error you encountered! If you have more specific details or need further assistance, feel free to ask.

## why  When using GROUP BY, you must ensure that every column in the SELECT list that is not part of an aggregate function is included in the GROUP BY clause ? like if we group by other columns will it not affect the result set

Great question! Understanding why all non-aggregated columns in the `SELECT` list must be included in the `GROUP BY` clause is key to mastering SQL. Let’s delve into the reasoning behind this requirement and what happens if you don’t adhere to it.

### Why Columns Must Be in the `GROUP BY` Clause

1. **Grouping Concept**:
   - **Purpose of `GROUP BY`**: When you use `GROUP BY`, you are aggregating data based on specific columns. SQL groups rows that have the same values in those columns into a single group.
   - **Aggregated Result**: For each group, SQL needs to calculate aggregate values for other columns (using functions like `SUM`, `COUNT`, etc.). 

2. **Ambiguity Issue**:
   - **Non-Aggregated Columns**: If you select columns that are not part of an aggregate function and are not included in the `GROUP BY` clause, SQL does not know how to handle these columns because their values can vary within each group.
   - **Unclear Values**: For example, if you `GROUP BY` `product_id` but select `product_name` without aggregating it, SQL cannot determine which `product_name` to return because there could be multiple names within a single `product_id` group.

3. **Consistency and Determinism**:
   - **Consistent Output**: Including columns in the `GROUP BY` clause ensures that SQL can produce a consistent and predictable result set. Every column in the `SELECT` list that is not aggregated must be part of the `GROUP BY` clause to guarantee that SQL knows exactly how to combine or represent the rows in each group.

### Impact of Including More Columns in `GROUP BY`

- **Adding Columns to `GROUP BY`**: If you add more columns to the `GROUP BY` clause, SQL will group the rows more granularly. For example, grouping by both `product_id` and `category_id` will create groups based on both columns. This will often result in more groups and, consequently, a more detailed result set.

- **Example Scenario**:

  Suppose you have the following data:

  | product_id | product_name | category_id |
  |------------|--------------|-------------|
  | 1          | Widget A      | 10          |
  | 1          | Widget A      | 11          |
  | 2          | Widget B      | 10          |
  | 2          | Widget B      | 10          |

  If you use:

  ```sql
  SELECT product_id, product_name, COUNT(*)
  FROM products
  GROUP BY product_id;
  ```

  SQL might produce an error if `product_name` is not included in the `GROUP BY` clause because it could be different for each `product_id` in the group. To avoid the error, you would need:

  ```sql
  SELECT product_id, product_name, COUNT(*)
  FROM products
  GROUP BY product_id, product_name;
  ```

  This query ensures each combination of `product_id` and `product_name` is treated as a unique group, and counts are aggregated accordingly.

### Summary

- **Non-Aggregated Columns**: Must be included in the `GROUP BY` clause to avoid ambiguity and ensure that SQL can correctly aggregate and display results.
- **Effect of Additional Columns**: Adding more columns to `GROUP BY` results in finer grouping, which can change the granularity of your results.

The rule that all non-aggregated columns must be in the `GROUP BY` clause helps SQL maintain clarity and consistency in its results. If you ever encounter issues with grouping, checking that your `GROUP BY` clause includes all relevant columns should be one of your first troubleshooting steps.

## can you explain this with a proper and complex example 

Certainly! Let's go through a detailed and complex example to illustrate how `GROUP BY` works, why certain columns must be included in the `GROUP BY` clause, and how different columns in `GROUP BY` affect the results.

### Scenario

Imagine we have an e-commerce database with the following tables:

1. **Orders**: Contains details about customer orders.
   - `order_id`
   - `customer_id`
   - `order_date`
   - `total_amount`

2. **Order_Items**: Contains details about the items in each order.
   - `order_id`
   - `product_id`
   - `quantity`
   - `price_per_unit`

3. **Products**: Contains details about each product.
   - `product_id`
   - `product_name`
   - `category_id`

4. **Categories**: Contains details about product categories.
   - `category_id`
   - `category_name`

We want to generate a report that shows:
- Total sales amount for each product
- The number of orders in which each product was sold
- The average quantity of each product sold per order

### SQL Query and Explanation

Let’s start by writing a query to achieve this. We need to join these tables and then group by the `product_id` to aggregate the data.

```sql
SELECT
    p.product_id,
    p.product_name,
    c.category_name,
    SUM(oi.quantity * oi.price_per_unit) AS total_sales_amount,
    COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) AS number_of_orders,
    AVG(oi.quantity) AS average_quantity_per_order
FROM Orders o
JOIN Order_Items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
JOIN Products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
JOIN Categories c ON p.category_id = c.category_id
GROUP BY p.product_id, p.product_name, c.category_name;
```

### Explanation

1. **Joins**:
   - We join the `Orders` table with `Order_Items` to get item details for each order.
   - We then join `Order_Items` with `Products` to get product details.
   - Finally, we join `Products` with `Categories` to get category details.

2. **Aggregations**:
   - **`SUM(oi.quantity * oi.price_per_unit)`**: Calculates the total sales amount for each product.
   - **`COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id)`**: Counts the number of distinct orders that contain each product.
   - **`AVG(oi.quantity)`**: Computes the average quantity of each product sold per order.

3. **GROUP BY Clause**:
   - We group by `p.product_id`, `p.product_name`, and `c.category_name` because we need to aggregate data for each combination of these columns.
   - `p.product_id` and `p.product_name` are used to identify each product.
   - `c.category_name` is included to show the category of the product in the results.

### Why This Works

1. **Grouping Criteria**:
   - **`product_id`**: Uniquely identifies each product.
   - **`product_name`**: Provides a human-readable name for the product.
   - **`category_name`**: Adds context by showing which category the product belongs to.

2. **Inclusion in `GROUP BY`**:
   - All non-aggregated columns in the `SELECT` list (`p.product_id`, `p.product_name`, `c.category_name`) are included in the `GROUP BY` clause.
   - This is necessary because SQL needs to know how to group rows based on these columns to correctly calculate the aggregates.

### How Changing `GROUP BY` Affects Results

1. **Grouping by Fewer Columns**:
   ```sql
   SELECT
       p.product_id,
       SUM(oi.quantity * oi.price_per_unit) AS total_sales_amount,
       COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) AS number_of_orders,
       AVG(oi.quantity) AS average_quantity_per_order
   FROM Orders o
   JOIN Order_Items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
   JOIN Products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
   GROUP BY p.product_id;
   ```
   - **Result**: This query only groups by `product_id`. As a result, you will lose the `product_name` and `category_name` in the results. The aggregates will be computed for each `product_id`, but the report will not include these details.

2. **Grouping by Additional Columns**:
   ```sql
   SELECT
       p.product_id,
       p.product_name,
       c.category_name,
       SUM(oi.quantity * oi.price_per_unit) AS total_sales_amount,
       COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) AS number_of_orders,
       AVG(oi.quantity) AS average_quantity_per_order
   FROM Orders o
   JOIN Order_Items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
   JOIN Products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
   JOIN Categories c ON p.category_id = c.category_id
   GROUP BY p.product_id, p.product_name, c.category_name;
   ```
   - **Result**: This query groups by `product_id`, `product_name`, and `category_name`, providing a more detailed report with both product names and category names. Each unique combination of these columns will create a separate group.

### Summary

- **`GROUP BY` Clause**: Determines how SQL groups rows for aggregation. All selected columns that are not aggregated must be in this clause.
- **Impact of Grouping Columns**: Changing which columns are included in the `GROUP BY` affects the granularity and content of the result set. Grouping by more columns provides a more detailed breakdown, while grouping by fewer columns aggregates data into broader categories.

I hope this example clarifies how `GROUP BY` works and why it's essential to include all non-aggregated columns in the `GROUP BY` clause! If you have further questions or need more examples, feel free to ask.

## I understand everything but I just have a doubt like in examples where you are grouping fewer columns and adding additional columns , does the sum i.e total_sales_amount , number_of_orders, and avg_quantity per order change? how does the table actually form when you add more columns in group by

Great question! Let’s clarify how the aggregation results change when you adjust the columns in the `GROUP BY` clause. 

### How Grouping Affects Aggregations

When you change the columns you’re grouping by, you change the way SQL groups the rows before applying aggregate functions. Here’s how this affects the aggregation results:

1. **Fewer Columns in `GROUP BY`**:
   - **Grouping Fewer Columns**: When you group by fewer columns, SQL aggregates data into broader categories.
   - **Resulting Aggregations**: The aggregates (`SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`, etc.) are calculated for each unique combination of the grouped columns. With fewer columns, you generally end up with fewer groups.

2. **Additional Columns in `GROUP BY`**:
   - **Grouping More Columns**: Adding more columns to the `GROUP BY` clause creates more granular groups. Each unique combination of the grouped columns will form a separate group.
   - **Resulting Aggregations**: The aggregates are calculated for each unique group. With more columns, you typically end up with more groups, and each group will have a more specific context.

### Detailed Example

Let’s revisit our e-commerce scenario and see how adding columns to the `GROUP BY` affects the results.

#### Tables

1. **Products**:
   - `product_id`
   - `product_name`
   - `category_id`

2. **Categories**:
   - `category_id`
   - `category_name`

3. **Orders**:
   - `order_id`
   - `customer_id`
   - `order_date`
   - `total_amount`

4. **Order_Items**:
   - `order_id`
   - `product_id`
   - `quantity`
   - `price_per_unit`

#### Original Query with Grouping by Product ID Only

```sql
SELECT
    p.product_id,
    SUM(oi.quantity * oi.price_per_unit) AS total_sales_amount,
    COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) AS number_of_orders,
    AVG(oi.quantity) AS average_quantity_per_order
FROM Orders o
JOIN Order_Items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
JOIN Products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY p.product_id;
```

- **Result**: This query groups by `product_id`. So, the aggregates are computed for each product.

| product_id | total_sales_amount | number_of_orders | average_quantity_per_order |
|------------|---------------------|------------------|----------------------------|
| 1          | $500                | 10               | 5                          |
| 2          | $300                | 7                | 3                          |

#### Modified Query with Additional Columns in `GROUP BY`

```sql
SELECT
    p.product_id,
    p.product_name,
    c.category_name,
    SUM(oi.quantity * oi.price_per_unit) AS total_sales_amount,
    COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) AS number_of_orders,
    AVG(oi.quantity) AS average_quantity_per_order
FROM Orders o
JOIN Order_Items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
JOIN Products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
JOIN Categories c ON p.category_id = c.category_id
GROUP BY p.product_id, p.product_name, c.category_name;
```

- **Result**: This query groups by `product_id`, `product_name`, and `category_name`. Aggregates are now computed for each combination of these columns.

| product_id | product_name | category_name | total_sales_amount | number_of_orders | average_quantity_per_order |
|------------|--------------|---------------|---------------------|------------------|----------------------------|
| 1          | Widget A      | Electronics   | $200                | 4                | 4                          |
| 1          | Widget A      | Gadgets       | $300                | 6                | 6                          |
| 2          | Widget B      | Gadgets       | $300                | 7                | 3                          |

### How the Aggregation Changes

1. **Grouping by Fewer Columns**:
   - Aggregates are calculated over a broader set of rows.
   - Fewer groups result in fewer rows in the result set.
   - Example: Total sales for product `1` aggregated over all categories.

2. **Grouping by More Columns**:
   - Aggregates are calculated for more specific combinations.
   - More groups result in more rows in the result set.
   - Example: Total sales for product `1` broken down by each category.

### Understanding the Result Set

When you **group by fewer columns**, the result set aggregates data across all rows that share the values of those columns. When you **group by additional columns**, SQL creates more detailed sub-groups within each original group. This leads to:

- **More Detailed Results**: Each row in the result set represents a unique combination of the columns specified in the `GROUP BY` clause.
- **More Rows**: Adding more columns to `GROUP BY` increases the number of possible combinations and thus the number of rows in the result set.

### Summary

- **Fewer Grouping Columns**: Results in broader groups, fewer rows, and aggregates calculated over larger sets of data.
- **Additional Grouping Columns**: Results in more specific groups, more rows, and aggregates calculated over smaller, more detailed subsets of data.

This granular control allows you to tailor your reports to different levels of detail depending on your needs. If you need more specifics or have further questions, feel free to ask!
